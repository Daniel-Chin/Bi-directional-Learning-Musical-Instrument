Professor ____:

Greetings. I hope this email finds you well! I am Daniel Chin, applying to the ____ 2021 PhD program from NYU Shanghai. 

I wish I found your publications earlier! Human-in-the-loop ML for music creation is my HCI dream. 

Attached is my 1-page research proposal. In short, I want a co-adaptation between a human and her bespoke musical instrument. Could I ask for some feedback? A little advice from you will surely light the way for me! 

I greatly appreciate your time! Also, will you be taking PhD students in 2021? 

Best regards, 
Daniel
