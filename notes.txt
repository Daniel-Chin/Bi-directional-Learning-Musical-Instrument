    domain danger:
        1) training time domian highly variable
        2) listen-to-music training is a diff domain; imagine-familiar-music is a diff domain from improvise-novel-music.

    Just read Fiebrink's papers and their refs. IML mainly refers to uni-directional learning with human in the loop. My idea is bi-directional with haptic guidance, and that is the main novelty.

    Playalong co-adaptation
        Ref: Co-adaptive calibration to improve BCI efficiency. Vidaurre. 
        Sight-play a score. You hear what the instrument generates. Don't stop on mistake. This way, both learns. Afterwards, mark your own mistakes. 
        Eye tracking! (controls score progression)
    Domain danger
        see 12/10 notes
        "Users exhibit a different mental state during offline calibration and online feedback"
            viewed as a problem by them. biLearn: that's the entire point! 
    12/29 notes extension:
        level 1: IML    (Fails and Olsen)
             provide more effective training data
        level 2: co-adapt   (The Effect of Co-adaptive Learning & Feedback in Interactive Machine Learning)
            moving target. 
                (this can bring soul to the machine)
            Learning. 
                " Adaptation was evident because the accuracy of models as calculated through cross-validation against recorded examples is lower than the average accuracy measured during new performances with the models"
        level 3: haptic guidance

    Domain danger: 
        "non-stationarities". 
        "Towards adaptive classification for BCI". Pradeep Shenoy.
        We may face the same problem, but not so much, since human will feel feedback and know where to go. Music production is also accurate, so on-line unsupervised adaption to input data domain may not be fast enough.
